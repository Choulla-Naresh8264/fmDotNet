## Test Setup

To run the integration tests, you must have the fmDotNet.Tests.fmp12 file hosted on a FileMaker Server. 

 1. Deploy FM file to FMS
 2. Update app.config in fmDotNet.Tests project to point to your server.
 3. Run tests, verify results.
 
This is the test and demo data used to make sure fmDotNet is working properly.
